### Usage

#### Notice ⚠️

1. `Select Translate` requires the `Auxiliary Accessibility`. It is necessary to use **Shortcut select translate** to trigger the application auxiliary accessibility permission, and then use auto select translate normally.

2. For screenshot Translate, you need to enable `Screen Recording` permission. The application will only automatically pop up a permission application dialog box when you use **Screenshot Translation** for the first time. If the authorization fails, you need to turn it on in the system settings manually.

### Services

**Currently, we support Youdao Dictionary, macOS system translation, DeepL, Google, Baidu and Volcano translation, total 6 translation services.**

> Notice ⚠️: Since the Chinese version of Google Translate is currently unavailable, you can only use the international version, so you need to use a proxy to use Google Translate.

> Notice: ⚠️ means the translation of source language to Traditional Chinese is not supported, such as DeepL. If you enter Traditional Chinese for translation, it will be treated as Simplified Chinese.

### Preferences

The settings page provides some preference setting modifications, such as automatically playing word pronunciation after turning on query, modifying translation shortcut keys, turning on and off services, or adjusting the order of services, etc.

#### Settting

![iShot_2023-01-20_11.46.57-1674186468](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tisfeng/ImageBed/main/uPic/iShot_2023-01-20_11.46.57-1674186468.png)

#### Services

Easydict has 3 types of windows and you can set different services for each of them.

- Mini window: displayed when the mouse automatically picks up words.
- Side hover window: displayed when shortcut keys are used to fetch words and screenshot translation.
- Main window: closed by default, you can turn it on in the settings and show it when the program starts. (The main window function will be enhanced later)

![iShot_2023-01-20_11.47.34-1674186506](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tisfeng/ImageBed/main/uPic/iShot_2023-01-20_11.47.34-1674186506.png)

#### Other Shortcuts

- `Enter`: After entering text, press Enter to start the query.
- `Shift + Enter`: Enter a line feed.
- `Cmd + Enter`: Opens Google search engine by default, and the search content is the entered text, which is equivalent to manually clicking the Google search icon in the upper right corner. 
- `Opt + Enter`: If you have the Eudic App installed on your computer, an Eudic icon will be displayed to the left of the Safari icon, and the shortcut will open the Eudic App for searching.

## Motivation

Looking up words and translating text is a very useful function in daily life. I have used many translation dictionaries, but I was not satisfied until I met Bob. [`Bob`](https://bobtranslate.com/) is an excellent translation software, but it is not open source and no longer provides free application updates since it hit the Apple Store.

As a developer and beneficiary of a lot of open source software, I think that there should be a free open source version of [Bob](https://github.com/ripperhe/Bob) in the world, so I made [Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict).

Now I use Easydict a lot every day, I like it very much, and I hope more people can know it and use it.

Open source makes the world better.

## Thanks

This project was inspired by [saladict](https://github.com/crimx/ext-saladict) and [Bob](https://github.com/ripperhe/Bob), and the initial version was developed based on [Bob](https://github.com/cheonvo/Bob). [Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict) has made many improvements and optimizations on the original project, and many features and UI are referenced from Bob, thanks to the original author [ripperhe](https://github.com/ripperhe).
