# OCR Test Images

These images are used exclusively for OCR-related unit tests in the test bundle.
They are not part of the app's runtime assets.

Naming convention:
- Prefix indicates language or content type (e.g., ocr-en, ocr-zh, ocr-ja, ocr-ru).
- Descriptors indicate scenario (e.g., text, poetry, paper, number).
- Numeric suffixes are test sample identifiers.
