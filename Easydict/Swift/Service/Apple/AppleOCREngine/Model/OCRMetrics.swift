// MARK: - OCRMetrics

/// Comprehensive statistical metrics and context data repository for OCR text processing
///
/// This central metrics collection serves as the authoritative data source for all OCR
/// text analysis and processing decisions. It maintains document-wide statistics,
/// spatial measurements, and contextual information that enable intelligent text
/// merging, formatting, and layout analysis.
///
/// **Primary Responsibilities:**
/// - **Document Statistics**: Line heights, spacings, character counts, and text patterns
/// - **Spatial Analysis**: Position data, indentation patterns, and layout measurements
/// - **Reference Observations**: Key text observations used for comparative analysis
/// - **Processing Context**: Language settings, source images, and configuration data
/// - **Threshold Calculations**: Dynamic thresholds based on document characteristics
///
/// **Key Metric Categories:**
/// 1. **Line Measurements**: Heights, spacings, and positioning data
/// 2. **Text Analysis**: Character counts, word patterns, and language-specific metrics
/// 3. **Reference Points**: Longest lines, minimum positions, and boundary observations
/// 4. **Calculated Thresholds**: Dynamic values for same-line detection and formatting decisions
///
/// **Usage Pattern:**
/// ```swift
/// let metrics = OCRMetrics(language: .english)
/// // OR
/// let metrics = OCRMetrics(ocrImage: image, language: .english, textObservations: observations)
/// let isLongLine = metrics.averageCharacterWidth > 0 && lineMeasurer.isLongLine(observation)
/// ```
///
/// Essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy across the entire OCR processing pipeline.
