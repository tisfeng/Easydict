// MARK: - OCRMergeDecision

/// Strategic decisions for merging adjacent text observations in OCR processing
///
/// This enumeration represents the three fundamental strategies for combining text
/// observations based on their spatial relationships, content characteristics, and
/// formatting requirements. Each decision type produces different output formatting
/// to preserve the original document's structure and readability.
///
/// **Decision Types:**
/// - **None**: Normal text continuation with space separation
/// - **Line Break**: Intentional line separation while maintaining text flow
/// - **New Paragraph**: Major content division requiring paragraph separation
///
/// **Impact on Output:**
/// - `.none`: "word1 word2" (space-separated continuation)
/// - `.lineBreak`: "word1\nword2" (single line break)
/// - `.newParagraph`: "word1\n\nword2" (double line break for paragraph)
///
/// **Usage Context:**
/// Used throughout the text merging pipeline to make consistent formatting
/// decisions that preserve document structure while ensuring readability.
enum OCRMergeDecision {
    /// Normal text continuation - join with space separation
    ///
    /// Used when text observations represent continuous prose that should flow
    /// naturally together. This is the most common case for regular paragraph text.
    case none

    /// Intentional line break - preserve line structure
    ///
    /// Used when the original document has intentional line breaks that should be
    /// preserved, such as in poetry, lists, or formatted text blocks.

    ///

    /// formatting, such as between different topics or major document sections.

    /// - If `isNewParagraph` is true: Returns `.newParagraph`
    /// - Else if `needLineBreak` is true: Returns `.lineBreak`

    ///   - isNewParagraph: Whether a new paragraph should be started
