// MARK: - OCRPoetryDetector

/// Specialized detector for identifying poetic text layouts in OCR results
///
/// This intelligent detector analyzes text patterns to identify poetry and verse
/// structures that require special formatting treatment. Poetry often has unique
/// characteristics that distinguish it from regular prose text.
///
/// **Detection Criteria:**
/// - **Line Length Patterns**: Short, varied line lengths typical of poetry
/// - **Character Count Analysis**: Lines with significantly fewer characters than prose
/// - **Spatial Arrangement**: Irregular line endings and intentional white space
/// - **Language Context**: Different patterns for different languages (Chinese vs English)
/// - **Consistency Patterns**: Multiple short lines indicating intentional structure
///
/// **Poetry Characteristics Detected:**
/// - Traditional poetry with regular meter and rhyme
/// - Free verse with intentional line breaks
/// - Chinese classical poetry with balanced character counts
/// - Modern poetry with irregular formatting
///
/// **Impact on Text Processing:**
/// - Preserves intentional line breaks in poetic text
/// - Prevents unwanted text merging that would destroy poetic structure
/// - Applies appropriate spacing and formatting for readability
///
/// Essential for maintaining the artistic and structural integrity of poetic content.

    /// Analyze text layout patterns to determine if content represents poetry
    ///
    /// This sophisticated analysis examines multiple characteristics of the text layout
    /// to make an intelligent determination about whether the content is poetic in nature.
    /// The detection is crucial for preserving proper formatting in the final output.
    ///
    /// **Analysis Process:**
    /// 1. **Minimum Line Requirements**: Ensures sufficient content for reliable detection
    /// 2. **Character Count Analysis**: Calculates average characters per line
    /// 3. **Line Length Patterns**: Examines consistency and variation in line lengths
    /// 4. **Short Line Detection**: Identifies patterns of intentionally short lines
    /// 5. **Language-specific Rules**: Applies different thresholds for different languages
    /// 6. **Long Line Analysis**: Detects patterns of consecutive long lines that indicate prose
    /// 7. **Punctuation Patterns**: Analyzes ending punctuation frequency
    /// 8. **Word Density**: Examines word count per line ratios
    ///
    /// **Detection Thresholds:**
    /// - Requires minimum 3 lines for reliable pattern analysis
    /// - Uses language-specific character count limits
    /// - Considers percentage of short lines vs total lines
    /// - Factors in average line length relative to typical prose
    /// - Analyzes consecutive long line patterns (prose indicator)
    /// - Evaluates punctuation frequency and patterns
    ///
    /// **Language-specific Adaptations:**
    /// - Chinese: Uses character-based analysis with different thresholds
    /// - English: Uses word-based analysis with space considerations
    /// - General: Applies universal patterns for other languages
    ///
    /// - Returns: true if text layout indicates poetry, false for regular prose
    /// - Note: Conservative approach to avoid false positives that could break normal text
