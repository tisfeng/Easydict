// MARK: - OCRLineMeasurer

/// Specialized measurement system for analyzing text line characteristics in OCR processing
///
/// This centralized measurement system provides comprehensive analysis of text line properties,
/// serving as the authoritative source for all line-length-related decisions in the OCR pipeline.
/// It consolidates complex measurement logic and provides consistent metrics across all components.
///
/// **Core Measurements:**
/// - **Line Length Analysis**: Determines if lines are "long" or "short" relative to available space
/// - **Remaining Space Calculation**: Measures how much space is left on each line
/// - **Character Capacity**: Estimates how many more characters could fit on a line
/// - **Relative Length Comparison**: Compares lines against maximum observed lengths
/// - **Language-specific Metrics**: Applies different measurement rules for different languages
///
/// **Use Cases:**
/// - Poetry detection (short lines often indicate poetic structure)
/// - Text merging decisions (long lines may need different treatment)
/// - Layout analysis (understanding document structure)
/// - Quality assessment (very short lines may indicate OCR issues)
///
/// **Measurement Approach:**
/// - Uses character width calculations for precise space estimation
/// - Considers document-wide patterns for relative measurements
/// - Applies language-specific thresholds and rules
/// - Provides both absolute and relative measurement metrics
///
/// Essential for making intelligent decisions about text layout and formatting preservation.

    /// Determine if a text line is considered "long" based on remaining character space analysis
    ///
    /// This sophisticated measurement method analyzes how much space remains at the end of a text line
    /// to determine if it should be considered "long" for text merging purposes. A "long" line typically
    /// indicates the text continues naturally to the next line, while a "short" line may indicate
    /// intentional breaks (poetry, lists, paragraphs).
    ///
    /// **Measurement Strategy:**
    /// - Calculates actual remaining horizontal space in the line
    /// - Converts space to character count using average character width
    /// - Compares against intelligent threshold based on content analysis
    /// - Uses document-wide patterns for context-aware decisions
    ///
    /// **Threshold Calculation:**
    /// - Default threshold varies by language and content type
    /// - Space-separated languages (English): Uses word boundary analysis
    /// - Character-based languages (Chinese): Uses character-based calculations
    /// - Poetry/special content: Applies different thresholds
    ///
    /// **Use Cases:**
    /// - Text merging decisions (should lines be joined?)
    /// - Poetry detection (short lines often indicate intentional breaks)
    /// - List formatting (preserving list structure)
    /// - Paragraph boundary detection
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - observation: The text observation to analyze for line length
    ///   - minimumRemainingCharacters: Custom threshold for remaining characters (uses smart default if nil)
    /// - Returns: true if line is considered "long" (little space remaining), false if "short"
