      description: |
        If the issue is reproducible, please provide detailed steps to reproduce it. Otherwise, the developer may not be able to locate the issue.
        If the issue is intermittent, you can try restarting Easydict, restarting your computer, or uninstalling and reinstalling the application to see if the problem can be resolved 🤔
        Note: Given the limited resources of the developer, only issues that can be reliably reproduced will be addressed at this time. For non-reproducible issues, they will be simply recorded for future observation.
